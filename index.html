# Make the website **NOT inaccesible**
<!---
Access to meaningful and effective contents on the Internet 
integral part of our modern life

As more and more of our social infrastructure is made available on the Internet - in some cases, exclusively online - access to information and electronic technologies is increasingly becoming the gateway civil rights issue for individuals with disabilities (Non-discrimination, Equal Opportunity). - Bobby Silverstein, the behind-the-scenes architect of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
