Accessibility in one sprint - a talk by Daigo Fujiwara

WARNING! I am not an accessibility expert, -- quite the opposite, I had no idea what I was doing --- and I am not encouraging that accessibility be after thoughts. Rather, this is what I learned from doing an accessibility crash course and how we at wbur.org applied what we learned. It is a work in progress towards inaccess free world, but hopefully you will learn small things that you can do to improive. Topics covered, WCAG 2.0.

He has previously worked at The Boston Globe, Harvard Business Review, Christian Science Monitor, Inc Magazine and Fast Company Magazine.â€‹
